Tools used: Spring boot, Bootstrap 5, Thymeleaf, a little bit of JS, JACKSON library for JSON parsing.

In order to complete this exercise a couple assumptions were made. Firstly, in the instruction I was asked to search by "date" so I didn't include time
(I concluded that date != datetime). I also presumed that (because arrival date was not present in the JSON template and therafore in the generated data) arrival date is the departure date.
(I wasn't sure If I'm suppose to come up with that date myself).
