Tools used: Spring boot, Bootstrap 5, Thymeleaf, JS, JACKSON library for JSON parsing.

In order to complete this exercise a couple assumptions were made. Firstly, in the instruction I was asked to search by "date" so I didn't include time (I concluded that date != datetime). I also presumed that (because arrival date was not present in the given JSON template and therefore in the generated data) the arrival date is the departure date (I wasn't sure If I'm supposed to come up with that date myself).

Instruction:

For requested flight Number and date:
1. Calculate cargo weight for requested flight.
2. Baggage weight for requested flight.
3. Total weight for requested flight.

For requested IATA Airport Code and date:
1. Calculate number of flights departing from this airport.
2. Calculate number of flight arriving to this airport.
3. Total number (pieces) of baggage arriving to this airport.
4. Total number (pieces) of baggage departing from this airport.
